# ImageDataGenerator-for-Data-Augmentation
This repository provides examples and utilities for performing data augmentation using TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the diversity of training data by applying random transformations such as rotations, flips, shifts, and more. This helps improve the robustness and generalization of machine learning models, particularly in computer vision tasks.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (preferably TensorFlow 2.x)
Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (optional, for running examples)
