# Transfer Learning for COVID-19 Detection

This repository explores transfer learning techniques using VGG16 and Inception models for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images.

## Introduction

The rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 is critical in combating the ongoing pandemic. This project utilizes transfer learning, a powerful method in machine learning, to leverage pre-trained models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. We compare the performance of two popular models: VGG16 and Inception.

## Models and Results

### VGG16 Model

- **Training Results**:
  - Loss: 1.0743
  - Accuracy: 44.22%

- **Validation Results**:
  - Loss: 1.0948
  - Accuracy: 39.39%

### Inception Model

- **Training Results**:
  - Loss: 0.2057
  - Accuracy: 92.43%

- **Validation Results**:
  - Loss: 0.1058
  - Accuracy: 93.94%

## Methodology

Both models were fine-tuned using a dataset consisting of chest X-ray images of COVID-19 positive cases and other respiratory conditions. The training and validation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in this domain.
