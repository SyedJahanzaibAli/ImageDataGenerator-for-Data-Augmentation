### Cat vs Dog Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates how to classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python with TensorFlow/Keras. The dataset used is the famous Kaggle competition dataset where images are labeled as either cats or dogs.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

#### Dataset
The dataset used is from the Kaggle competition "Dogs vs. Cats". You can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) (requires Kaggle account).

#### Files
1. **train/** - Directory containing training images labeled as `cat.*.jpg` and `dog.*.jpg`.
2. **test1/** - Directory containing test images for which predictions are to be made (unlabeled).

#### Files in Repository
- `cat_vs_dog_classification.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the code for training the CNN model and making predictions on test images.
- `README.md` (this file) - Overview and instructions.

#### Instructions

1. **Setup**
   - Download and extract the dataset into a directory named `data/` at the root of this project.
   - Ensure Python 3.x and necessary libraries are installed.

2. **Training**
   - Run `cat_vs_dog_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment that supports `.ipynb` files.
   - The notebook contains step-by-step instructions from loading the data to defining the CNN architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - The `ImageDataGenerator` from Keras is used for automatic labeling and optionally for data augmentation.
   - Automatic labeling is achieved by organizing images into subdirectories `train/cat` and `train/dog`.
   - Example:
     ```
     train/
     ├── cat
     │   ├── cat.1.jpg
     │   ├── cat.2.jpg
     │   └── ...
     └── dog
         ├── dog.1.jpg
         ├── dog.2.jpg
         └── ...
     ```

4. **Model Architecture**
   - The CNN model includes layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, and Dropout.
   - `BatchNormalization()` is used to normalize the activations of a previous layer at each batch, while `Dropout(0.1)` is used to prevent overfitting.

5. **Evaluation**
   - The model's performance metrics like accuracy, loss, and validation accuracy are monitored during training.
   - Adjust the number of epochs based on the convergence of these metrics.

6. **Prediction**
   - Once trained, the model is used to predict labels (`cat` or `dog`) for test images in the `test1/` directory.
   - Results can be visualized and further analyzed as per the notebook instructions.

#### Improvements
- Experiment with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters to further improve accuracy.
- Implement augmentation techniques using `ImageDataGenerator` for better generalization.
- Fine-tune the model by adjusting parameters like learning rate and batch size.

#### Conclusion
This project provides a basic implementation of CNN for image classification using TensorFlow/Keras on the Cat vs. Dog dataset. It serves as a starting point for learning CNNs and can be extended for more complex tasks and datasets.
